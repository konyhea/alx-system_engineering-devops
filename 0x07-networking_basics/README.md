Networking Fundamentals
MAC (Media Access Control)
A unique identifier assigned to network interfaces (e.g., Ethernet cards, Wi-Fi cards)
Used to address devices at the data link layer (Layer 2 of the OSI model)
Typically represented as a 12-digit hexadecimal number (e.g., 00:11:22:33:44:55)
IP (Internet Protocol)
A protocol used for addressing and routing packets at the network layer (Layer 3 of the OSI model)
Allows devices to communicate with each other on a network and across networks
Uses IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to identify devices
Network Types
LAN (Local Area Network)
A computer network that spans a small geographical area (e.g., home, office building)
Typically owned and managed by a single organization
WAN (Wide Area Network)
A computer network that covers a large geographical area (e.g., city, country)
Often used to connect multiple LANs together
Wi-Fi
A wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to a network without cables
OSI Model
A 7-layered framework for understanding how data is transmitted over a network
Layers:
Physical (Layer 1)
Data Link (Layer 2)
Network (Layer 3)
Transport (Layer 4)
Session (Layer 5)
Presentation (Layer 6)
Application (Layer 7)
